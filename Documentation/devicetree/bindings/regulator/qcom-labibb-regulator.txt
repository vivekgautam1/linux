Qualcomm's LAB(LCD AMOLED BOOST)/IBB(Inverting Buck-Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a standalone positive boost power supply for general purpose
applications. IBB can be used as a standalone negative power supply for general
applications. Also, LAB and IBB can be used together to provide power supply for
display panels.

Main node required properties:

- compatible:			Must be "qcom,lab-ibb-regulator"
- #address-cells:		Must be 1
- #size-cells:			Must be 0

LAB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "lab".
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.

IBB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "ibb".
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.

Example:
	pmi8998_lsid1: pmic@3 {
		qcom-labibb-regulator {
			compatible = "qcom,lab-ibb-regulator";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			lab_regulator: qcom,lab@de00 {
				reg = <0xde00>;
				reg-names = "lab";
				regulator-name = "lab_reg";
			};

			ibb_regulator: qcom,ibb@dc00 {
				reg = <0xdc00>;
				reg-names = "ibb";
				regulator-name = "ibb_reg";
			};

		};
	};
