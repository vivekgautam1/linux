Qualcomm SMD-RPM interconnect driver binding
------------------------------------------------
The RPM is a dedicated hardware engine for managing the shared
SoC resources in order to keep the lowest power profile. It
communicates with other hardware subsystems via shared memory
and accepts requests for various resources.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,interconnect-smd-rpm"

Example:
	smd {
		compatible = "qcom,smd";

		rpm {
			interrupts = <0 168 1>;
			qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 0>;
			qcom,smd-edge = <15>;

			rpm_requests {
				compatible = "qcom,rpm-msm8916";
				qcom,smd-channels = "rpm_requests";

				interconnect-smd-rpm {
					compatible = "qcom,interconnect-smd-rpm";
				};

			};
		};
	};
