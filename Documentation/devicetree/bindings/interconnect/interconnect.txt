Interconnect Provider Device Tree Bindings
=========================================

The purpose of this document is to define a common set of generic interconnect
providers/consumers properties.


= interconnect providers =

The interconnect provider binding is intended to represent the interconnect
controllers in the system. Each provider registers a set of interconnect
nodes, which expose the interconnect related capabilities of the interconnect
to consumer drivers. These capabilities can be throughput, latency, priority
etc. The consumer drivers set constraints on interconnect path (or endpoints)
depending on the use case. Interconnect providers can also be interconnect
consumers, such as in the case where two network-on-chip fabrics interface
directly

Required properties:
- compatible : contains the interconnect provider compatible string
