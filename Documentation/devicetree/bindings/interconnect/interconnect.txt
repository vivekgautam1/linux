Interconnect Provider Device Tree Bindings
=========================================

The purpose of this document is to define a common set of generic interconnect
providers/consumers properties.


= interconnect providers =

The interconnect provider binding is intended to represent the interconnect
controllers in the system. Each provider registers a set of interconnect
nodes, which expose the interconnect related capabilities of the interconnect
to consumer drivers. These capabilities can be throughput, latency, priority
etc. The consumer drivers set constraints on interconnect path (or endpoints)
depending on the use case. Interconnect providers can also be interconnect
consumers, such as in the case where two network-on-chip fabrics interface
directly

Required properties:
- compatible : contains the interconnect provider compatible string


= interconnect consumers =

The interconnect consumers are device nodes which consume the interconnect
path(s) provided by the interconnect provider. There can be multiple
interconnect providers on a SoC and the consumer may consume multiple paths
from different providers depending on use case and the components it has to
interact with.

Required properties:
interconnects : Pairs of phandles and interconnect provider specifier to denote
	        the edge source and destination ports of the interconnect path.

Optional properties:
interconnect-names : List of interconnect path name strings sorted in the same
		     order as the interconnects property. Consumers drivers will use
		     interconnect-names to match interconnect paths with interconnect
		     specifiers.

Example:

	sdhci@7864000 {
		...
		interconnects = <&pnoc 78 &bimc 512>;
		interconnect-names = "ddr";
	};
