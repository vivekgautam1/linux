Qualcomm QMP PHY
----------------

Required properties:
 - compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,qmp-14nm-phy".
 - reg: offset and length of the PHY register set.
 - #phy-cells: must be 2.
    - Cell after phy phandle is device type from:
	- PHY_TYPE_PCIE
	- PHY_TYPE_UFS
	- PHY_TYPE_USB3
    - Second cell should be the port (lane) number.
 - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in clock-names.
 - clock-names: must be "cfg_ahb" for phy config clock,
			"aux" for phy aux clock,
			"ref_clk" for 19.2 MHz ref clk,
			"ref_clk_src" reference clock source,
			"pipe" pipe clock (Optional).
 - resets: a list of phandles and reset controller specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in reset-names.
 - reset-names: must be	"phy" for reset of phy block,
			"common" for phy common reset,
			"cfg" for phy's ahb cfg reset (Optional).
 - vdda-phy-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to PHY core block.
 - vdda-pll-supply: Phandle to 1.8V regulator supply to PHY refclk pll block.

Optional properties:
 - vddp-ref-clk-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to any specific reflclk
			pll block.

Required nodes:
 Each device node of QMP phy is required to have as many child nodes as
 the number of ports (lanes) PHY has.

Required properties (port/child node):
 - tx-offset: offset to port's Tx register address space.
 - rx-offset: offset to port's Rx register address space.
 - pcs-offset: offset to port's PCS register address space.

Optional properties (port/child node):
 - resets: a list of phandles and reset controller specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in reset-names.
 - reset-names: "lane<port-number>" for reset specific to
		each port (lane).

Example:
	pcie_phy: pciephy@34000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qmp-14nm-phy";
		reg = <0x034000 0x3fff>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#phy-cells = <2>;

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_PCIE_PHY_AUX_CLK>,
			<&gcc GCC_PCIE_PHY_CFG_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "aux", "cfg_ahb";

		vdda-phy-supply = <&pm8994_l28>;
		vdda-pll-supply = <&pm8994_l12>;

		resets = <&gcc GCC_PCIE_PHY_BCR>,
			<&gcc GCC_PCIE_PHY_COM_BCR>,
			<&gcc GCC_PCIE_PHY_COM_NOCSR_BCR>;
		reset-names = "phy", "common", "cfg";

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			tx-offset = <0x1000>;
			rx-offset = <0x1200>;
			pcs-offset = <0x1400>;
			resets = <&gcc GCC_PCIE_0_PHY_BCR>;
			reset-names = "lane0";
		};
		...
	};
