Qualcomm QMP PHY
----------------

Required properties:
 - compatible: compatible list, contains "qcom,qmp-14nm-phy".

 - reg: offset and length of the pcie PHY register set.
 - reg-names: must be:	"serdes" for serial deserializer,
			"tx" for tx specific registers,
			"rx" for rx specific registers,
			"pcs" for pcs specific registers.

 - #phy-cells: must be 2
    - Cell after phy phandle is device type from:
	- PHY_TYPE_PCIE
	- PHY_TYPE_UFS
	- PHY_TYPE_USB3
    - Second cell should be the port number.

 - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in clock-names.
 - clock-names: must be "cfg_ahb" for phy config clock,
			"aux" for phy aux clock,
			"ref_clk" for 19.2 MHz ref clk,
			"ref_clk_src" reference clock source.
			"pipe" pipe clock (Optional)

 - resets: a list of phandles and reset controller specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in reset-names.
 - reset-names: must be	"phy" for reset of phy block,
			"common" for phy common reset,
			"cfg" for phy's ahb cfg reset (Optional),
			"port<port-number>" for reset specific to
			  each port (Optional)

 - vdda-phy-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to PHY core block.
 - vdda-pll-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to PHY refclk pll block.
 - vddp-ref-clk-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to any specific reflclk
			pll block (Optional).

 - nlanes: Number of lanes supported by the phy.
 - lane-offset: address offset at which the lanes are separated from one
		 another in memory space (Optional, valid only for phys that
		 have nlanes > 1).
