Qualcomm APR (Asynchronous Packet Router) binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm APR. APR is a IPC protocol for
communication between Application processor and QDSP. APR is mainly
used for audio/voice services on the QDSP.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,apr-v<VERSION-NUMBER>", example "qcom,apr-v2"

- qcom,apr-dest-domain-id
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Destination processor ID.
	Possible values are :
			1 - APR simulator
			2 - PC
			3 - MODEM
			4 - ADSP
			5 - APPS
			6 - MODEM2
			7 - APPS2

= APR SERVICES
Each subnode of the APR node can represent service tied to this apr. The name
of the nodes are not important. The properties of these nodes are defined
by the individual bindings for the specific service
- but must contain the following property:

- qcom,apr-svc-id
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: APR Service ID, used for matching the service.
	Possible values are :
			3 - DSP Core Service
			4 - Audio Front End Service.
			5 - Voice Stream Manager Service.
			6 - Voice processing manager.
			7 - Audio Stream Manager Service.
			8 - Audio Device Manager Service.
			9 - Multimode voice manager.
			10 - Core voice stream.
			11 - Core voice processor.
			12 - Ultrasound stream manager.
			13 - Listen stream manager.

- qcom,apr-svc-name
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: User readable name of a APR service.

= APR DEVICES:
Each subnode of the APR node can represent devices tied to this apr, like
sound-card. The properties of these nodes are defined by the individual
bindings for the specific device.

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a QDSP based sound card on a MSM8996 device
which uses apr as communication between Apps and QDSP.

	apr {
		compatible = "qcom,apr-v2";
		qcom,smd-channels = "apr_audio_svc";
		qcom,apr-dest-domain-id = <APR_DOMAIN_ADSP>;

		q6core {
			compatible = "qcom,q6core";
			qcom,apr-svc-name = "CORE";
			qcom,apr-svc-id = <APR_SVC_ADSP_CORE>;
		};

		q6afe {
			compatible = "qcom,q6afe";
			qcom,apr-svc-name = "AFE";
			qcom,apr-svc-id = <APR_SVC_AFE>;
		};

		audio {
			compatible = "qcom,msm8996-snd-card";
			...
		};
	};
