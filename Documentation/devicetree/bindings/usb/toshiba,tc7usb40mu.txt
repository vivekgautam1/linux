Toshiba TC7USB40MU

This device muxes USB D+/D- lines between two outputs called 1D+/1D- and 2D+/2D-.
When the switch pin is asserted, we mux out 2D+/2D-, and when it's deasserted we
select 1D+/1D-.

This can be used to mux USB D+/D- lines between a USB hub and an OTG port.

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <string>
    Definition: Should contain "toshiba,tc7usb40mu"

- switch-gpios:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Should contain the gpio used to toggle the switch. Logically
                asserting the gpio will cause the device to mux the "host"
                D+/D- lines instead of the "device" lines.

- extcon:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Should contain the extcon device for USB_HOST cable events

Example:

	usb-switch {
		compatible = "toshiba,tc7usb40mu";
		switch-gpios = <&gpio 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		extcon = <&usb_id>;
	};
