* Qualcomm Technologies APQ8096 ASoC sound card driver

This binding describes the APQ8096 sound card, which uses qdsp for audio.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,apq8096-sndcard"

- qcom,audio-routing:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition:  A list of the connections between audio components.
		  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
		  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
		  source. Valid names could be power supplies, MicBias
		  of codec and the jacks on the board:

= FRONTEND and BACKEND dailinks
Each subnode of sndcard represents either frontend or backend dailink,
and subnodes of each backend/frontend dailinks would be
cpu/codec/platform dais.

- link-name:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: User friendly name for dai link

- is-fe:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <bool>
	Definition: present if the dailink is frontend


= CPU, PLATFORM, CODEC dais subnodes
- cpu:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: cpu dai sub-node

- codec:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: codec dai sub-node

- platform:
	Usage: opional
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: platform dai sub-node

- sound-dai:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: dai phandle/s and port of CPU/CODEC/PLATFORM node.

Example:

audio {
	compatible = "qcom,apq8096-sndcard";
	qcom,model = "DB820c";
	qcom,audio-routing =
		"RX_BIAS", "MCLK";

	fedai1 {
		is-fe;
		link-name = "MultiMedia1 Playback";
		cpu {
			sound-dai = <&q6asm  MSM_FRONTEND_DAI_MULTIMEDIA1>;
		};
		platform {
			sound-dai = <&q6asm  MSM_FRONTEND_DAI_MULTIMEDIA1>;
		};
	};

	bedai1 {
		link-name = "HDMI Playback";
		cpu {
			sound-dai = <&q6afe AFE_PORT_HDMI_RX>;
		};

		platform {
			sound-dai = <&q6adm>;
		};

		codec {
			sound-dai = <&hdmi 0>;
		};
	};
};
